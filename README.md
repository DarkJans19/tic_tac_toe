# Tic Tac Toe: Miku Pear vs Teto Pear

This is a simple game of Tic Tac Toe, but with a twist:  
You play using **Miku Pear** as X and **Teto Pear** as O!  
It's probably the best Tic Tac Toe game you'll see in a while (at least if you like pears and Vocaloid).

The game is made with [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/), and while the code isn't super fancy, I just wanted to have some fun coding a classic game with a personal touch.

## How to Play

- Run the script with Python (you need to have pygame installed).
- Click on the board to place your Miku or Teto pear.
- Click the **Reset** button if you want to start over.
- Enjoy the cuteness!

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pygame

## Disclaimer

This was made for fun and learning, so don't expect perfect code or advanced features.  
But if you love Miku, Teto, or pears, or all at the same time you'll probably have a good time!

I hope you enjoy it!
